# ate-cable-mapper-mini

Implements a (very (very)) simple two-port cable mapper and tester which outputs a complete map of the cable-under-test in a JSON-ish form.

Still on the immediate to-do list are:

- [ ] adding a simple SCPI-like command interface; and
- [ ] adding the ability to validate cables-under-test against known-good or expected mappings.
